# SHORT DESCRIPTION

Opens a Milestone XProtect database to read information or export recordings.

# LONG DESCRIPTION

The `MilestoneSystems.PowerShell.MediaDB` module uses the Milestone .NET SDK to
open Milestone's native media database files, or "banks". By running the
`Open-MediaDatabase` command with the path of your media database `cache.xml`
file, and optional encryption password, you will be able to retrieve the list
of cameras and other devices with data in the database bank, retrieve a list of
recording or motion sequences, and export recordings in MKV format.

This module has a dependency on the `MilestonePSTools` PowerShell module which
is available on the PowerShell Gallery. Documentation on this module can be
found at www.milestonepstools.com.
